<h3> Hello! Welcome to the page where you will find some extra information. </h3>

<p> We are studying the Master in Big Data & Analytics, and we have developed a Shiny Dashboard
about the League, where you are able to see the historical classifications of the competition, as well as various
comparisons between the different teams. We have chosen this theme as we are passionate about
sports and the statistics they generate. </p>

  <td> I am a lover of sports, and of data science. One of my greatest passions is football, which largely motivated the choice of this theme. Developing a Shiny Dashboard was the best setting to get the best of me by visualizing a sector that I know and from which to get the most out of it.  </td>
  <td> I am keen on AI and studying a master of Big Data with the target of becoming data scientist in the short-term. Moreover, I am passionate about cybersecurity and programming. Some of my personal hobbies are: reading books, dancing and playing basketball. </td>
